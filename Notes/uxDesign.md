"Don't make me think" - Steve Krug

# Simplicity
Lycos: Input boxes were pretty new. Would people know what it meant? It used to be super complicated. Then google came along and it was super simple. The thing you will do is search. Then Lycos followed along.
THen ther eis pintrest. There is a lot going on, but all of the same subjects (centered around a theme).

# Design as a story
See philadelphia tourism. They have a story: "Come for Philadelphia. Stay for Philly." 

# Color
Generate a palette. Use three or four major colors. Primary color, secondary color, then a second secondary color for focus (the call to action color). You have different shades too.
`paletton.com`, `color.adobe.com`

Color palette: AA8F66, ED9B40, FFEEDB, 61C9A8 BA3B46

Be sure to use constant colors. Then you don't have hundreds of different colors.

# Consistent
Layout: main in the center, header and footer. In the header there can be an app bar, left is navigation, top right is settings and user. Popout on the right.

A good way to do this is to use a ui framework (like bootstrap)

# Navigation
Not building London when building an app. More like building SLC. The way to do this is to make a Sitemap. Ask what the user is trying to accomplish. What is the linkage between all the sites? Do you need to go back before searching something. For mine, you had to go back to login to logout until I added the logout button.

Display location, browser controls, breadcrumbs (need to be able to go in and out), anticipate common paths (is it hard to get to somewhere).

# Typography
Look at the anotomy of a Typeface.
- Serif has little strokes (often used for titiles)
- sans serif has no little strokes (often used for books and main content)
- monospace will all lign up in a column
- handwriting: kind of weird
The less fonts the better. (Probably the same thing with colors)

# Text
Consistent choosing of font sizes.
- 72px: Page title
- 42px: Main titles (H2)
- 32p: Subtitles (H3)

**See chart**

2 inches wide vs 4 inches wide vs 8 inches wide vs 16 inches wide

# Iconography
Hamburger: menu
Triagnle with circles thing: share button
X: close button

# Whitespace
How does it affect our perception? How does it affect the way we have said it? What about dark mode? It affects the way we see information.

# Interaction
Add interaction: like with picking a car. Adding interaction keeps people engaged. 

# Image
Professor Jensen: Must add value to an article.

# Animation
Sometimes too much movement, sometimes a little bit is super helpful. Don't use everything unless it is intentional.

# Decision fatigue
Hick's law: The time necessary to make a decision increases logarithmically with the number of choices presented. Break things down into discreet tasks. So users have to make less decisions.

# Responsive
Using grid and flex. Will it work for different screen sizes.

# Accessibility
Visual: screen reader support, high contrast theme
Audio: closed caption, visual animation
Physical: keyboard navigation, element ordering

# Legal
Privacy: GDPR
Education: FERPA
Health: HIPPA
Payment: PCI

# Walls
Things that stop your customer from doing what they want to do. (The hardest part is setting up the payment.)
- Registration
- Payment
- Login
- Navigation
- Legal

A call to pay. If you show it first users will be less likely to look at your content rather than reading it and then realizing you have to pay for more.

Cookies, is it blocking the screen?

# Internationalization
- Language
- Currency
- Times and Dates
- Numbers
- Icons
- Images

Can we render it in chinese? How about arabic (right to left which reverses everything)

These things need to be built into the entire application (like showing numbers).
