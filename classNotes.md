The communication between these is the network.

Startup: will have 9 deliverables. Think 100 to 200 lines of code for each deliverable.s
Frontend:
1) Spec: specification and pitch
2) AWS: rent a server and get a domain name
3) HTML: structure of the code
4) CSS: write the style
5) React 1: use JavaScript for web framework
6) React 2: user interaction
Backend:
7) Service: return requested data
8) Database/Login: authentication data (security)
9) WebSocket: server sends information to client without a request

Startup ideas:
- game
- chat
- url sharing
- shared story authoring
- book reviews
- location sharing
- calendaring
- voting
- favorite website sharing
- weather tracking
- Bank
It needs to be able to send updates to the client without a request. That will satisfy the WebSocket need. Send live updates.

## Git
The .git contains the history and all the changes. Clone and push/pull connects the developer environment to GitHub. Cloning takes things from github and gives it to us. We add and commit it on our end.
Clone vs push pull?
